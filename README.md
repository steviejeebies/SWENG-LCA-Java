# Lowest Common Ancestor on Binary Search Tree & Directed Acyclic Graph(Java)
* All tests passing
* Code coverage 100%

This is my implementation for LCA on a BST, written in Java (using the Intellij IDE). 

Branch "acyclic" has been merged, with further tests added. Name of the test file "BSTTest" has been changed to "LCATest"

I chose Java as the language to initially write the program in because it is by far the one which I have the most experience with. I'm getting far more effective with Intellij now after switching over from Eclipse, and this project helped a lot on that front. Although I wrote the initial BST program in Java first, when I was writing the tests I did both simultaneously, finishing the Python tests first, as I found writing tests from scratch in Python was more intuitive.
